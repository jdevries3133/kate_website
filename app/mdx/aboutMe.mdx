  The twitter embed height is configured in "app/config.ts". The height of the
  twitter embed (in pixels) must be hard coded, but you can adjust that number
  to make the height of the embed roughly match the height of your about
  section. If they mismatch, the embed becomes super long by default, and the
  page layout gets wonky.

  I intentionally left it kind of messed up so you can see how it's _not_
  supposed to look, and experiment with fixing it. The correct number as of
  writing should be around 900! It does not need to be a perfect match.

# About Me

They say that you’ve never really made it until you have a whole website about yourself. 

My name is Kate, I’m a writer and editor working in New York City. I was always a creative kid, running the Literary Society in my high school with my classmates, competing in poetry slams, writing the extra credit essays and eventually ending up with a BA in Comparative Literature and French from NYU’s College of Arts and Science. I even graduated with honors, having written a completely optional thesis that no one’s read besides three professors and myself. However, if you'd like to change that, you can [read it here.](/static/thesis.pdf) Although I'd only recommend it for the deeply pretentious or those who identify with Emma Bovary (if you're in the latter group, I would also recommend cognitive behavioral therapy. But read the thesis first).

After graduation, I started working in the translation field, with an agency coordinating English projects for copywriting, French translation, website integration and SEO, and eventually moved my way up to project management. Throughout this time, I continually fostered my love and passion for creative work and writing, especially during the 2020/2021 lockdowns, during which I wrote a short story, that turned into a script, then a novel, that is now my debut novel. I also published intermittently on Medium and will now migrate that work to this site.

However, the main motivation for this site is simply credibility: all the coolest people and most publishable people have a stable Internet presence. While I’ve existed on the Internet in one shape or another for years (you can read more about that in [my first blog post](/post/firstPost)), I’ve never had a space just for Kate, the Super Serious, Important, Talented Writer. And now that I’ve written that, it has to be true, right?

Feel free to peruse, to comment, to share, and if you’re really interested in my writings, reach out to me personally. I’m happy to answer questions, gauge your feedback and hear anything you may have to share. And once again, it’s very nice to meet you.
