# In The Beginning

My name is Kate, and this is the beginning of my website. I'm very used to creating things on the Internet: my mother first allowed me to have a Facebook account in 2008 when I was twelve, and my brain is permanently altered because of it. But unlike social media, this whole webiste, this whole domain and every page and post, are just for me and by me. It's like if Facebook was called KateBook.

## Why Am I Here?

Pretty much the only reason I have this site is because I'm a writer, and during intermittent lockdowns in New York in 2021, I finally finished my first manuscript. I did so during NaNoWriMo, the somewhat infamous National Novel Writing Month that takes place in November. I'd always wanted to be a part of that, having started and stopped many years before, but 2021 was when I finally did it.

But while I've already proved to myself that I'm a writer, being an author is a completely separate endeavor, one that involves the politics of publishing and knowing who you know. And, despite the Internet knowing and loving me, I remain unknown for now.

## Where I've Been

During university, I studied Comparative Literature and French, and wrote an undergraduate thesis for no reason on Gustave Flaubert and Honore de Balzac. This means two things: that I love languages and Realism, and that I'm a bit annoying.

I would occasionally contribute poetry to a feminist journal called The Rational Creature, and also post poems and essays on Medium. But again, these were mediums that I was a part of, nothing that I built for and by myself.

After graduating, I got a job as a translation project manager for an agency in New York, all the while writing on the side. Creative writing is my passion, and sometimes I wish it was the 1910s where I could just disappear to Europe and smoke cigarettes and drink gin with other annoying people who would later become either horrifically famous or dead.
