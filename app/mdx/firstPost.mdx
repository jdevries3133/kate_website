# In The Beginning

My name is Kate, and this is the beginning of my website. I'm very used to creating things on the Internet: my mother first allowed me to have a Facebook account in 2008 when I was twelve, and my brain is permanently altered because of it. But unlike social media, this whole webiste, this whole domain and every page and post, are just for me and by me. It's like if Facebook was called KateBook.

## Why Am I Here?

Pretty much the only reason I have this site is because I'm a writer, and during intermittent lockdowns in New York in 2021, I finally finished my first manuscript. I did so during NaNoWriMo, the somewhat infamous National Novel Writing Month that takes place in November. I'd always wanted to be a part of that, having started and stopped many years before, but 2021 was when I finally did it.

But while I've already proved to myself that I'm a writer, being an author is a completely separate endeavor, one that involves the politics of publishing and knowing who you know. And, despite the Internet knowing and loving me, I remain unknown for now.

## Where I've Been

During university, I studied Comparative Literature and French, and wrote an undergraduate thesis for no reason on Gustave Flaubert and Honore de Balzac. This means two things: that I love languages and Realism, and that I'm a bit annoying.

I would occasionally contribute poetry to a feminist journal called The Rational Creature, and also post poems and essays on Medium. But again, these were mediums that I was a part of, nothing that I built for and by myself.

After graduating, I got a job as a translation project manager for an agency in New York, all the while writing on the side. Creative writing is my passion, and sometimes I wish it was the 1910s where I could just disappear to Europe and smoke cigarettes and drink gin with other annoying people who would later become either horrifically famous or dead.

- switched the font to helvetica
- switched to a light colorscheme
- removed annoying autocomplete pop-up
- enabled text wrapping (so you can just type as usual without manually needing to manage putting newlines)

You can write posts using markdown. It's super easy; here is a rundown of the syntax:

# Primary Heading

## Secondary Heading

### Tertiary Heading

#### etc.

Text can be _italic_.

Text can be **bold**.

Text can be `monospaced`.

- you
- can
- make some
- bullet point lists

1. Numbered
2. Lists
3. Exist
4. Too

Also, this looks cursed but it renders as a normal list and avoids you needing to renumber numbered lists:

1. First item
1. Second item; yes, it will display as "2. ..."
1. You get the idea

Notice that paragraphs are simply separated by two blank lines.

If
you
put
a
single
blank
line,
markdown
considers
that
a
continuous
run
of
text
anyway...

# Notes About Metadata Header (at the top of the file)

Title, description, and "created" fields are required for every post. There
will be an error if you forget to include them. This metadata is integrated
into the sitemap, and provided to twitter, facebook, etc. to provide nice link
previews for your posts.

## Optional Header Fields

Optionally, you can include a `lastUpdated` or `thumbnail` fields. All of these
fields are fully integrated with SEO, so their values will appear on Twitter,
in the little link preview card, and Google will also index the `lastUpdated`
field if you provide it, which can make your site rank higher. Be careful not
to "lie" about `lastUpdated`, though. Only update it if you actually change the
content of the page, or else Google will become sad (and penalize you for
lying!).

## Other Stuff (imports)

The beauty of this mdx format is that it's super flexible to add dynamic
components later I can write these components and then it's super easy for you
to use them! For example, I have this nifty image component:

<Image src="/static/cat.webp" caption="Look at this cute little lad!" />

I also have a component for full-width code samples! Definitely not useful for
your website, but the sky is the limit when it comes to the components I can
create to support your blog posts.
