# Beginning of Content

You can write posts using markdown. It's super easy; there is some simple syntax
for common text formatting:

# Primary Heading

## Secondary Heading

### Tertiary Heading

#### etc.

Text can be _italic_.

Text can be *bold*.

Text can be `monospaced`.

# Metadata Header (at the top of the file)

Title, description, and "created" fields are required for every post. There
will be an error if you forget to include them. This metadata is integrated
into the sitemap, and provided to twitter, facebook, etc. to provide nice link
previews for your posts.

## Optional Fields

Optionally, you can include a `lastUpdated` or `thumbnail` fields. All of these
fields are fully integrated with SEO, so their values will appear on Twitter,
in the little link preview card, and Google will also index the `lastUpdated`
field if you provide it, which can make your site rank higher. Be careful not
to "lie" about `lastUpdated`, though. Only update it if you actually change the
content of the page, or else Google will become sad (and penalize you for
lying!).

## Other Stuff (imports)

The beauty of this mdx format is that it's super flexible to add dynamic
components later I can write these components and then it's super easy for you
to use them! For example, I have this nifty image component:

<Image src="/static/cat.webp" caption="Look at this cute little lad!" />

I also have a component for full-width code samples! Definitely not useful for
your website, but the sky is the limit when it comes to the components I can
create to support your blog posts.
