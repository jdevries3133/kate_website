It's been raining a lot in my area recently, after a horrifically dry and hot summer. On Monday evening, I was walking home in the wind and rain, desperate to hold onto my umbrella, and realized that I was, of all things, embarrassed. Something about holding onto an umbrella, an otherwise unassuming tool, and fighting the wind, the poles snapping or the fabric turning inside out, unable to listen to music or focus on my walk, was humiliating in a visceral way, and I really don't know why. Something about needing help and that help _failing_ was so awkward and disconcerting.

# The Plight of Query Letters
As most of my life lately has been revolving around querying agents to get my book made, it's no surprised that all I could think of on my rainy and chaotic walk home was just that: the trials and tribulations of something that every aspiring author goes through. For context, my manuscript's first draft was finished in December 2021, and I'm currently on Version 5, and have been querying agents along the way. So far, I've reached out to dozens of agents, albeit casually: some people blast out hundreds of emails a day, a concept to me that seems so jarring and intense I can't bring myself to do it. Others get lucky on their first try, which is something I desperately manifested and dreamed of, to no avail. 

Every day, I look at my "Query Letters" folder on my computer and despair: sending emails off into the void, to either never receive a reply or to be rejected, would dishearten even the strongest of minds. And so when I escape and find myself distressed in the rain, my umbrella slipping and flipping, the water fogging up my glasses, it simultaneously freezing outside while I'm also sweating somehow, I can't help but feel that same embarrassment. _I can't even hold an umbrella right. I can't even get this novel out into the world._

# Staying Dry
This is an embarrassment that is, at the end of the day, unfounded: we cannot control the weather just as we cannot control the chaos that must be a perspective agent's email inbox (I cannot even imagine what it looks like). But when I finally got home and dried off, the conclusion wasn't about myself or my circumstances, but about my tools: I don't need to be different; I need to be _doing something_ different. And that involves getting a new umbrella.

In the world of Query Letters, there are thousands of blog posts, helpful guides, zines, paid proofreaders and analysts to help perfectly craft just one email to one agent. But no matter what avenue you choose to take, the tools are there. Sometimes, they won't work for you, even if that's what they're designed to do. Even the mightiest umbrella is not the right tool for a hurricane. So I'm finding solace in that I am not a failure, even if I might be failing a bit right now. I just need to reassess my umbrella, even deciding that maybe, I shouldn't be going outside at all.

Right now, I'm taking a break from sending out new query letters to just manage my inbox and my expectations. By writing it here, I'm officially giving myself permission to do just that.
